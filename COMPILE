To compile:

* Make sure that the required libraries are present; check the current
  list here:
  http://code.google.com/p/lopes-eventbrowser/wiki/LibraryDependency

* If you installed ROOT+QtROOT from the using the script
  http://root.bnl.gov/QtRoot/INSTALL_QTROOT.sh, you should now run one
  of the set_enviroment.* scripts according to your shell. If you did
  not install using the script, do the following item:

* Make sure that the environmental variables ROOTSYS and
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains paths to ROOT. Typical values would be
  ROOTSYS=/user/local/root and
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/user/local/root/lib. (I'm not sure if this is
  actually needed, but) also set the enviromental variables QTDIR to
  your QT > 4.3 directory, and QTROOTSYSDIR to the directory
  containing QtROOT installation - this is typicall just the same as ROOTSYS.

* Make sure that qmake on the system is from Qt >= 4.3; one can check
  it by typing qmake --version. If multiple QT verions are present, make
  sure that instead of just typing qmake below, use the full path to the
  QT >= 4.3 version of qmake.


And then simply type:

qmake && make

or 

/path/to/qt4.3/qmake && make

----------------------------------------------------------------

To start the program after compiling, type

./browser

in the terminal.

----------------------------------------------------------------

If problems occur, do

rm -rf build

to remove the compiled objects, etc. before recompiling.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation flags:

DEBUG - to print additional useful debugging information in the console.
TREAT_INTEGER_AS_FLOAT - see explanation in ReadRootTree.cpp
USE_QT - this is for the non-UI parts of the program; I tried to keep
the non-UI part independent of QT, thus by undefining USE_QT, the
non-UI part can be use in outside project without having QT dependency.
