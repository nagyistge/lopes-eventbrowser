To compile:

* Make sure that the required libraries are present, and the environmental
variables ROOTSYS and LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains paths to ROOT 5.18. Typical
values would be ROOTSYS=/user/local/root and LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/user/local/root/lib.

* Make sure that qmake on the system is from Qt 3; one can check it by typing
qmake --version. If multiple QT verions are present, make sure that instead of
just typing qmake below, use the full path to the QT 3 version of qmake.

And then simply type:

qmake && make

or 

/path/to/qt3/qmake && make

To start the program after compiling, type

./browser

in the terminal.
