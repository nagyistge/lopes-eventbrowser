This package contains the compiled binary for lopes-eventbrowser. A small ROOT
file test_root_file_tree-ka104ev.root, and some sample config files are also
included to get you started.

To start, cd to the folder where you unpacked the files, and type 

browser.run

to run the eventbrowser. The browser.run is a shell script that sets the
enviromental variables to a known working path; you can change it to other
paths if needed.
