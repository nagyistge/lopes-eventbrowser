This package contains the compiled binary for lopes-eventbrowser. A small ROOT
file test_root_file_tree-ka104ev.root, and some sample config files are also
included to get you started.

THe script browser.run included in this package sets the enviromental
variables to a known working path of ROOT 5.18 in the IK.FZK cluster; if you
are running outside of the cluster, you can get compiled versions of ROOT
5.18 which satisfies the requirement of this program from the ROOT website:

http://root.cern.ch/root/Version518.html

After you unpacked the ROOT package, edit the path in the script file
browser.run to point to your unpacked ROOT folder.

Additionally, you need QT3 libraries to run this program; the libraries should
come with most standard Linux distributions.

-------------------------

To start the program, cd to the folder where you untar this package, and type
in the terminal:

. browser.run
